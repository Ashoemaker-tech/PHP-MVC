# M-Vue-C 
## PHP MVC framework 

This is my take at a model vue controller (see what I did there?) framewaork implementing models and controllers with php and rendering the UI with Vue.

This framework is designed out of the box to connect with mySQL database.

## Features
- reactive UI with Vue
- Routing & functionality with PHP
- Data queries and Database managment with PHP PDO statements.
